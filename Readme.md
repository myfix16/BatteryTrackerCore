### Function
The program will scan current battery percentage every 30s and then show it on the task bar. You can find the event-driven version from [here](https://github.com/myfix16/BatteryTrackerFramework).
### Features
1. Use different transparent icons for different percentages, thus looks more harmonious with the task bar (it has no black background).
2. It will **automatically switch icon color** when user change to Light/Dark mode. ✨
